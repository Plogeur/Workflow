RuleException in rule fastqc in file /Users/aliasmatis/Desktop/projects/Worflow/rules/alignment.smk, line 2:
NameError: The name "'res_dir'" is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:
mkdir -p {config['res_dir']} | fastqc {input} --threads {threads} --outdir {output}
