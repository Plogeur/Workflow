MissingOutputException in rule bwa_index in file /Users/aliasmatis/Desktop/projects/Worflow/rules/alignment.smk, line 17:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
indexed (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
