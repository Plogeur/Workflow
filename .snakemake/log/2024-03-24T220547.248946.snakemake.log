Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule samtools_index in file /Users/aliasmatis/Desktop/projects/Worflow/rules/alignment.smk, line 68:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/sample.bam.bai (missing locally, parent dir contents: sample.indexed.amb, sample.indexed.bwt, sample.fixed.sam, .DS_Store, sample.sorted.bam.bai, sample.indexed.sa, sample.sorted.bam, sample.indexed.ann, sample.bam, sample.indexed.pac, sample.sam)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
