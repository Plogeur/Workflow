Job 1: Index du génome de référence :sample
Reason: Missing output files: data/sample.fa.bwt

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule bwa_index in file /Users/aliasmatis/Desktop/projects/Worflow/Snakefile, line 24:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/sample.fa.bwt (missing locally, parent dir contents: sample.fastq, svs.vcf, instructions.pdf, .DS_Store, ref.fa, ref.fa.bwt, ref.fa.amb, ref.fa.pac, ref.fa.sa, ref.fa.ann)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
