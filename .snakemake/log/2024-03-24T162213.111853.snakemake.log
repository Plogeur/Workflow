NameError: The name 'gatk_calling_options' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        $GATK HaplotypeCaller -t {threads} -R {input.reference} -I {input.bam_md_clipped} -ERC GVCF --output {output.gvcf} {gatk_calling_options}"
