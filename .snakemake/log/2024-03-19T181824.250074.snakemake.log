MissingOutputException in rule fastqc in file /Users/aliasmatis/Desktop/projects/Worflow/rules/alignment.smk, line 2:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/sample_fastqc.html (missing locally, parent dir contents: reads.trimed.aligned.sorted.bam.bai, reads.trimed.aligned.sorted.bam)
results/sample_fastqc.zip (missing locally, parent dir contents: reads.trimed.aligned.sorted.bam.bai, reads.trimed.aligned.sorted.bam)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
