Error in rule bwa_mapping:
    jobid: 1
    input: results/indexed.bwt, data/ref.fa
    output: results/indexed.trimed.sam
    log: logs/bwa_mapping.log (check log file(s) for error details)
    shell:
        bwa mem -t 2 results/indexed results/indexed.bwt data/ref.fa > results/indexed.trimed.sam
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job bwa_mapping since they might be corrupted:
results/indexed.trimed.sam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
